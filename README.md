# Image Compression Using k-means Clustering

This program performs `k-means clustering` using the RGB values of each pixel in an image as features. The thousands of unique colors in the image are essentially averaged to `K` different colors. The outputs at various `K` values are shown below.

Place image to be compressed  `image.png` in `images` folder.
