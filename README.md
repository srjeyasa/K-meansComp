# Image Compression Using k-means Clustering
This program performs `k-means clustering` using the RGB values of each pixel as features. The thousands of colors in the image are essentially averaged to `K` different colors. The outputs at various `K` values are shown below.

Place image to be compressed  `image.png` in `images` folder.

![](/images/3_colors.png)
![](/images/5_colors.png)
![](/images/8_colors.png)
![](/images/32_colors.png)

This project builds on the assignments for the Coursera MOOC: [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
